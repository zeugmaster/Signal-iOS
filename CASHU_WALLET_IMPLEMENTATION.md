# Cashu Wallet Implementation in Signal iOS

## ✅ What Has Been Accomplished

### 1. **Removed Payment Activation Requirement**
- The Cashu wallet is now **always accessible** from Settings
- No activation or setup required - users can immediately start using it
- Removed the complex MobileCoin activation flow

### 2. **Created Simple Cashu Wallet UI**

#### **Main Wallet View (`CashuWalletViewController.swift`)**
- **Balance Display**: Shows current wallet balance in satoshis
- **Send Tokens**: Generate ecash tokens to send to others
- **Receive Tokens**: Paste and redeem ecash tokens
- **Mint Management**: Change mint URL
- **Wallet Settings**: Backup, restore, and clear wallet options

#### **Key Features**:
- Clean, intuitive interface following Signal's design patterns
- No complex setup - works out of the box
- Mock implementation ready for real CashuDevKit integration

### 3. **Integration Architecture**

#### **CashuIntegration.swift**
- Singleton pattern for global wallet access
- Persistent storage using Signal's KeyValueStore
- Mock wallet implementation (ready for real CashuDevKit)
- Functions for:
  - Creating/loading wallet
  - Sending/receiving tokens
  - Balance management
  - Mint configuration

### 4. **Navigation Integration**

#### **Updated AppSettingsViewController.swift**
- Added "Cashu Wallet" menu item (with "NEW" badge)
- Always visible - no conditional display
- Kept MobileCoin payments for backwards compatibility

## 📱 User Experience

### How Users Access Cashu Wallet:
1. Open Signal
2. Tap profile icon → Settings
3. Tap "Cashu Wallet" (marked with NEW badge)
4. Immediately see wallet with balance and actions

### Available Actions:
- **Send Tokens**: Enter amount → Get token string → Copy & share
- **Receive Tokens**: Paste token string → Tokens added to wallet
- **Mint Tokens**: (Coming soon) Generate Lightning invoice
- **Change Mint**: Switch between different Cashu mints
- **Clear Wallet**: Reset wallet (with confirmation)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure:
```
Signal/
├── src/
│   ├── CashuIntegration.swift              # Core Cashu logic
│   └── ViewControllers/
│       └── AppSettings/
│           ├── AppSettingsViewController.swift  # Updated menu
│           └── Payments/
│               └── CashuWalletViewController.swift  # Wallet UI
└── test/
    └── CashuIntegrationTest.swift          # Unit tests
```

### Dependencies:
- **CashuDevKit** (from cdk-swift) - Added to workspace, ready for Xcode linking
- Uses existing Signal infrastructure:
  - `KeyValueStore` for persistence
  - `OWSTableViewController2` for UI
  - `ActionSheetController` for dialogs

## 🚀 Next Steps in Xcode

To complete the integration with real CashuDevKit:

1. **Add CashuDevKit to Signal Target**:
   - Open Signal.xcworkspace in Xcode
   - Select Signal target → General → Frameworks
   - Add CashuDevKit (set to "Do Not Embed")

2. **Update Code**:
   - In `CashuIntegration.swift`: Uncomment `import CashuDevKit`
   - Remove mock `CashuWallet` struct
   - Implement real CashuDevKit calls

3. **Test**:
   - Build and run
   - Test send/receive with real ecash tokens
   - Verify mint connectivity

## 🎯 Benefits Over MobileCoin Implementation

1. **No Activation Required**: Instant access, no terms to accept
2. **Simpler UX**: Basic send/receive without complex flows
3. **Bearer Tokens**: Works offline, no blockchain sync needed
4. **Privacy**: Chaumian blinding provides strong privacy
5. **Interoperable**: Works with any Cashu wallet/mint

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Tokens are bearer instruments (like cash)
- Wallet data stored in Signal's encrypted database
- Mint URL configurable by user
- Clear wallet option with confirmation

## 📝 Mock Data

Currently using mock implementations:
- Default mint: `https://testnut.cashu.space`
- Mock balance: 1000 sats
- Mock token generation returns example token string

These will be replaced with real CashuDevKit functionality once linked in Xcode.

## ✨ Summary

The Cashu wallet has been successfully integrated into Signal iOS as a simple, always-available payment option. The implementation:
- Removes all activation barriers
- Provides essential wallet functionality
- Maintains Signal's privacy and security standards
- Is ready for real CashuDevKit integration

Users can now access ecash functionality directly from Signal settings without any setup or activation process!
