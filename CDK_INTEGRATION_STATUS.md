# CashuDevKit Integration Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Resolved SPM Cache Issue**
- Cleared corrupted binary artifact cache at `~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/artifacts/`
- Successfully resolved the "already exists in file system" error

### 2. **Added cdk-swift to Signal Workspace**
- Modified `Signal.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata` to include local cdk-swift package
- Package is now recognized by Xcode and builds successfully

### 3. **Verified Package Resolution**
- Successfully resolved package dependencies using `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies`
- CashuDevKit scheme now appears in workspace schemes
- Package builds successfully for iOS platform

### 4. **Created Integration Files**
- **`Signal/src/CashuIntegration.swift`**: Main integration point for Cashu functionality
- **`Signal/test/CashuIntegrationTest.swift`**: Unit tests for the integration
- **`CDK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive guide for completing the integration

### 5. **Maintained CocoaPods Compatibility**
- SPM integration doesn't interfere with existing CocoaPods setup
- Both dependency managers can coexist in the same workspace

## 📋 Next Steps in Xcode

To complete the integration and start using CashuDevKit in your Signal code:

### Step 1: Open Xcode
```bash
open /Users/dariolass/Developer/Signal-iOS/Signal.xcworkspace
```

### Step 2: Add CashuDevKit to Signal Target
1. Select the **Signal** project in the navigator
2. Select the **Signal** target
3. Go to **General** → **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**
4. Click **+** and add **CashuDevKit**
5. Set to **Do Not Embed**

### Step 3: Enable Import in Code
After adding to target, update `/Signal/src/CashuIntegration.swift`:
- Uncomment line 17: `// import CashuDevKit`
- Implement the TODO methods with actual CashuDevKit functionality

### Step 4: Run Tests
Build and run the test suite to verify integration:
- The test file is at `/Signal/test/CashuIntegrationTest.swift`

```

## 🔧 Commands for Maintenance

### Resolve packages:
```bash
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -workspace Signal.xcworkspace -scheme Signal
```

### Build CashuDevKit:
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace Signal.xcworkspace -scheme CashuDevKit -destination "generic/platform=iOS" build
```

### Clear SPM cache if needed:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/artifacts/*
```

## ✨ Benefits of This Integration

1. **Modern Swift Package**: CashuDevKit uses SPM, the modern Swift dependency manager
2. **Local Development**: Using local package reference allows easy modification and debugging
3. **No CocoaPods Conflict**: Both dependency managers work together seamlessly
4. **Type-Safe Integration**: Swift's type system ensures safe integration with Signal's codebase
5. **Testable**: Unit tests can verify the integration works correctly

## 🚀 Ready for Development

The cdk-swift package is now successfully integrated into the Signal iOS workspace. You can begin implementing Cashu functionality by:
1. Completing the Xcode configuration steps above
2. Implementing the methods in `CashuIntegration.swift`
3. Adding UI components for Cashu features
4. Integrating with Signal's existing payment infrastructure alongside MobileCoin

The integration maintains Signal's architecture while adding new Cashu capabilities through a clean, modular interface.
